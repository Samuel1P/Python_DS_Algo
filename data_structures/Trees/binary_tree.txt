Space complexity:

Formula: 2 ^ number of row - 1
-1 can be discared since it is insignigicant.
A Perfect Binary tree gives the best possible sceanrio (omega) is Omega(Log N).

The worst possible sceanrio is Tree that never forks (like a LinkedList). The Big O is O(n). This is a very rare case sceanrio, so we do not treat Binary Tree as O(n). Rather we treat is as O(Log n).
