# commonly used notation

O(n) - For looping a list. n is the number of items in the list. Proportional.
O(2n) can be written as O(n) -  We can drop the constants

O(n²) - Nested For loop. Loop within a loop.
O(n³) can be written as O(n²)

O(n²+ n) - We can drop the non dominants and write it as O(n²)

O(1) - Constant - Best performance
O(3) Can be written as O(1)

O(log n) - Divide and conquer. relates to performance we see in binary search on sorted list. A item in a million item long list can be found in ~30 operations.

O(n log n) - Sorting algos (merge sort)
